# ![Teapot/Tea](public/android-icon-48x48.png?raw=true "Tea") Teapot/Tea, a visual programming language
**"Teapot/Tea"** is a visual programming language. Designed to be very simple yet powerful and just incrediable awesome.
What ever you visually script within **"Tea"** is automaticly compiled to **C#**, **Java**, **TypeScript**, **Python** and **PHP**.
Scripting errors that might occur are helped to avoid as much as possible.

# How to run **"Tea"** scripts.
**"Teapot"** is a runtime within the languages mentioned, that helps run the compiled **"Tea"** scripts.
We really made the runtime work with the programming languages and be as thin as possible.
So that the performance of the languages is without any setbacks of using a visual programming language.

Externally imported libraries are carefully selected and can be used with the knowledge that in a form they are available within the mentioned programming languages.
This gives **"Tea"** the power of the existing programming languages and produces code that is absolutely 100% yours without any vendor locking.
All the **"Teapot"** runtimes and editor are provided under the MIT license and are free of charge.

# Teapot/Tea editor.
The **"Tea"** pot editor is the IDE to develop **"Tea"** scripts. And you are looking at its repository.

# **"Tea"** is designed to be easy.
If Java is another word for coffee we believe that programming in **"Tea"** should just be as relaxing and wellbeing as drinking a cup of tea.
Yes you heared it right. Get yourself a nice cup of tea and start programming with the following simple commands:

# Installation of the editor
To be up and running in no time you would need to install NodeJS, just grab a version for your operating system and run the following command from the root of the source:

```sh
npx install
```

# Running the editor
To run the application simple use the following command, and your good to go:

```sh
npx start
```

with that range of programming and scripting languages anyone can code flawlessly with just one single visual language.

# Demo please!
Take look at this kickass demo and see how easy it is to model your class with **"Tea"**.
